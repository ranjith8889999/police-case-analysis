The system follows a modular architecture with the following components:

1. **Frontend Layer**: HTML/CSS/jQuery-based user interface with Bootstrap for responsive design.
2. **Application Layer**: Flask web framework handling routing, user sessions, and business logic.
3. **Service Layer**: Contains core services for authentication, document processing, chat management, and AI interactions.
4. **Data Layer**: SQL Server database for structured data and ChromaDB vector database for document embeddings.
5. **AI Integration**: Google's Gemini AI for natural language processing and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

### Components Used

#### Backend Technologies:

- **Flask**: Web framework for building the application
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database operations
- **LangChain**: Framework for building applications with large language models
- **ChromaDB**: Vector database for document embeddings
- **PyODBC**: Database connector for MS SQL Server
- **Sentence Transformers**: For generating embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model)

#### Frontend Technologies:

- **HTML5/CSS3**: For structure and styling
- **jQuery**: For DOM manipulation and AJAX requests
- **Bootstrap 5.3**: For responsive design components
- **Font Awesome 6.4**: For icons
- **Animate.css**: For animations

#### AI and NLP:

- **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash**: Main LLM for generating responses
- **HuggingFace Embeddings**: For creating vector embeddings of documents
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: For improving AI responses with document context

#### Database:

- **Microsoft SQL Server**: Using LocalDB for structured data storage
- **ChromaDB**: Open-source vector database for similarity search
